# Project : Data Science - Next Word Predictor in R Programming
DataScienceCapstone project

This is the project of Coursera Data Science Specialization Capstone from Johns Hopkins University (JHU), partnered with SwiftKey (http://swiftkey.com/en/), is to deploy an interactive R Shiny application that predicts the next word based on a given input.

The major goal / objective of this project is to build an application using Shiny in which user will give input word / sentence in input box and this model will give outputs as  next predicted word . The data used in the model came from a corpus called HC Corpora (www.corpora.heliohost.org).
